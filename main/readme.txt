main.py is the central control layer of the K‑Julia AI Voice Automation System. It seamlessly connects the AI Engine, Voice Interaction System, and Dashboard & KPI Analytics into one unified, real‑time application.

What It Does
Orchestrates live voice interactions (STT → AI → TTS)

Routes user queries to the JuliaBrain AI engine

Logs every interaction for real‑time analytics and KPIs

Runs the Flask dashboard alongside the voice system

Why It Matters
This file turns independent modules into a single working product. It ensures clean separation of concerns while enabling scalable, plug‑and‑play integration—ideal for government‑grade, production‑ready AI voice systems.
